# Introduction

Hi, I'm @Akeel! I'm a software developer with a passion for building intuitive and user-friendly applications. I have experience with a wide range of technologies, including the **MERN and MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Angular, and Node.js)**.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, tinkering with open-source projects, and attending meetups and conferences. I'm also a big fan of learning from others, so I'm always open to collaboration and discussion with other developers. You can learn more about my experience and skills on my LinkedIn profile at **www.linkedin.com/in/akeel-lashley**.

If you want to get in touch or learn more about my work, you can reach me at **akeellashley@gmail.com**. I'm looking forward to connecting and sharing ideas!
