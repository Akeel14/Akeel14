# Introduction

Hi, I'm @Akeel! I'm a software developer with a passion for building intuitive and user-friendly applications. I have experience with a wide range of technologies, including the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), SwiftUI, and UIKit**.

I'm always looking to learn and improve my skills, so I'm currently focused on mastering the MERN stack and building full-stack web applications. I'm also exploring the latest features and capabilities of SwiftUI and UIKit, and working on building my skills in these areas. I believe that staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices is crucial for any developer, and I'm committed to staying on the cutting edge of the field.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, tinkering with open-source projects, and attending meetups and conferences. I'm also a big fan of learning from others, so I'm always open to collaboration and discussion with other developers. You can learn more about my experience and skills on my LinkedIn profile at **www.linkedin.com/in/akeel-lashley**.

If you want to get in touch or learn more about my work, you can reach me at **akeellashley@gmail.com**. I'm looking forward to connecting and sharing ideas!
